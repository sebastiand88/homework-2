        <b>Our Pizza</b> <br>
        Italian pizza? No, it‚Äôs Neapolitan. If you need to know why, just ask it from a Neapolitan and You will probably hear an hour long lecture what it‚Äôs all about. Long story short- Neapolitan pizza is a result of different cultures coming together. Historically the area was the mecca of different people coming from different places of the world. When Estonians usually ask how is weather in you country, the Neapolitans asked about the food that people eat in their homeland. This makes the cuisine so rich and you have the chance to try it here.
